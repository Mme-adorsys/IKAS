üîê Security Guidelines (Draft)

1. Authentication & Authorization
	‚Ä¢	All endpoints must be protected using OAuth 2.0 or JWT-based authentication.
	‚Ä¢	Role-based access control (RBAC) should be enforced at the API gateway and service level.
	‚Ä¢	Never hardcode credentials or tokens in source code. Use environment variables or secrets managers.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure password policies are enforced (min. 12 characters, complexity, expiry, no reuse).

‚∏ª

2. Data Protection
	‚Ä¢	All data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
	‚Ä¢	Sensitive data at rest must be encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent.
	‚Ä¢	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be stored and processed in compliance with GDPR.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., tokens, passwords, full names, email addresses).

‚∏ª

3. Secure Development Practices
	‚Ä¢	Validate all user input (both client-side and server-side) to prevent injection attacks.
	‚Ä¢	Sanitize output to avoid Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
	‚Ä¢	Perform regular dependency checks and keep third-party libraries up to date.

‚∏ª

4. API Security
	‚Ä¢	All public APIs must be rate-limited to prevent abuse (e.g., DoS).
	‚Ä¢	Use API gateways or service meshes to enforce centralized authentication, logging, and throttling.
	‚Ä¢	Enable CORS policies only for trusted domains.
	‚Ä¢	Define and enforce proper scopes and permissions for all API tokens.

‚∏ª

5. Infrastructure & Deployment
	‚Ä¢	Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) with version control and code review.
	‚Ä¢	Apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP) to all IAM roles and service accounts.
	‚Ä¢	All containers must be scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment.
	‚Ä¢	Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin and privileged access.

‚∏ª

6. Monitoring & Incident Response
	‚Ä¢	Enable centralized logging and real-time alerting for all critical systems.
	‚Ä¢	Define a security incident response plan with clear escalation paths.
	‚Ä¢	Retain logs for a minimum of 90 days for forensic analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Perform regular security drills and simulated breach tests.

‚∏ª

7. Compliance & Auditing
	‚Ä¢	All systems must adhere to relevant security standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, CIS).
	‚Ä¢	Regular security audits and penetration tests must be conducted at least once per year.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain an asset inventory and update it continuously.
	‚Ä¢	All findings from security reviews must be tracked and remediated in a timely manner.
